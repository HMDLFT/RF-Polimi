    <h2>Project Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of this project is to thoroughly comprehend the architecture of the RF front-end in a conversion receiver. This includes key components such as the amplifier, RF filter, mixer, local oscillator, IF filter, and more. The focus will be on explaining the operation and configuration of these blocks and circuits.

    <p>
        To start, the primary goal is to obtain parameters for the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) and Mixer through circuit simulations and update the circuit with their new models. Following this, the report will evaluate the RF front-end's performance by conducting simulations in both the absence and presence of phase noise using AWR software.
