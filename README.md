 ## About the RF Project
The objective of this project is to thoroughly comprehend the architecture of the RF front-end in a
conversion receiver, encompassing components such as an amplier, RF lter, mixer, local oscillator,
IF lter, and so on. The emphasis will be on elucidating the operation and conguration of these
blocks and circuits. To initiate this exploration, the primary focus will involve obtaining parameters
for the Low Noise Amplier (LNA) and Mixer through circuit simulations and replacing their new
models in the circuit. Following this, the report will proceed to assess the RF front-end's performance
by conducting simulations in the absence and presence of phase noise within the AWR software.
